# 🧠 Image Classifier using CNN

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification ML model built using TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies images into predefined categories (cats and dogs) using deep learning techniques, data augmentation, Accuracy/loss curves, model validation and includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction steps.
