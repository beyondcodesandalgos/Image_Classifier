Raw ML model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Utilized a labeled dataset of pet images and trained a neural network from scratch, CNN architecture (Conv, Pooling, Flatten, Dense), Data augmentation, Accuracy/loss curves and model validation.
